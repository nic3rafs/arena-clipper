# Save to Are.na Browser Extension

A simple browser extension that allows you to quickly save images from any webpage to your Are.na boards.

## Description

This extension adds a small save icon ("‚ßâ") when you hover over images on most websites. Clicking the icon initiates a process to save that image to one of your Are.na boards.

## Features

*   **Hover-to-Save:** An overlay appears on image hover, providing a quick save button.
*   **Are.na Authentication:** Securely connects to your Are.na account using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code flow). You only need to log in once.
*   **Board Selection UI:** After clicking the save button, a UI appears within the overlay allowing you to:
    *   View your 3 most recently updated Are.na boards (fetched initially when the list is empty).
    *   See the list update dynamically as you save items using the extension.
    *   Search for any of your boards by name.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The save button provides visual cues for loading, success (‚úÖ), failure (‚ùå), and authentication required (üîë).

## Installation (Development)

To install this extension locally for development:

**Chrome / Edge (Manifest V3):**

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right).
4.  Click "Load unpacked".
5.  Select the directory containing this `README.md` file (the root project directory).

**Firefox (Manifest V2):**

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.
3.  Click "This Firefox" on the left sidebar.
4.  Click "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5.  Select the `manifest.firefox.json` file from the project directory.

**Note:** For Firefox, the extension will be unloaded when you close the browser unless packaged and installed permanently.

### Running the Development Server

Once you have cloned the repository and installed dependencies (`pnpm install` or `npm install`), you can run the development server:

*   **For Chrome/Edge (or default):**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    # or
    npm run dev
    ```
*   **For Firefox:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev:firefox
    # or
    npm run dev:firefox
    ```

This will start Vite's development server. Changes to the source code should trigger automatic reloading of the extension in your browser (you might need to manually reload the extension once initially after starting the dev server). Remember to load the unpacked extension as described above if you haven't already.

## Configuration

Before the authentication flow can work, you need to replace the placeholder Are.na Client ID:

1.  Register a new application with Are.na developers: [https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications](https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications)
2.  Set the "Redirect URI" for your application during registration. You can find the correct redirect URI for *your specific browser and installation* by:
    *   Loading the extension temporarily (as described above).
    *   Opening the background script console (see Debugging below).
    *   Looking for the log message `Are.na Background Redirect URL: ...` near the top. Copy this value exactly.
3.  Open the file `src/background.ts`.
4.  Find the line `const CLIENT_ID = "ZMhCuoCSLMPEEHAv-ouY1Lk36bTwV-iNbJkL_q7zAjs";` (or similar).
5.  Replace the placeholder string with your actual Client ID obtained from Are.na.
6.  **Important:** Reload the extension in your browser after making this change.

## Development & Project Structure

*   **Manifest Files:**
    *   `manifest.json`: Manifest V3 for Chrome/Edge.
    *   `manifest.firefox.json`: Manifest V2 for Firefox.
*   **Source Directory (`src/`):**
    *   `background.ts`: Handles authentication flow (OAuth) and securely provides the API token to content scripts.
    *   `arena-api.ts`: Module for interacting with the Are.na API (fetching user info, channels, saving blocks) and managing local storage for the API token and the recent boards list (`populateInitialRecentBoards`, `getRecentBoards`, `saveToBoard`, `searchArenaBoards`).
    *   `content/`: Scripts and styles injected into web pages.
        *   `core-overlay.ts`: Responsible for creating and managing the visual overlay (calculating position, creating save button with icon/status elements, handling hover/mouseout logic) and the board selector UI (displaying recent/search results, handling selection/cancel/click-outside).
        *   `arena-handler.ts`: Coordinates the user interaction flow triggered by the save button click. Manages button states (loading, success, error, etc.), orchestrates calls to `arena-api.ts` (ensuring token, populating initial recents, getting recents, saving), and invokes the `showBoardSelector` UI from `core-overlay.ts`.
    *   `style.css`: CSS styles for the injected UI elements (overlay, button, board selector, lists, input).
*   **Assets:** `arena-logo.svg`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`.

### Debugging

*   **Content Scripts:** Open the regular Developer Tools (F12) on any webpage where the extension is active. Logs from `core-overlay.ts` and `arena-handler.ts` will appear in the Console tab.
*   **Background Script:**
    *   **Chrome/Edge:** Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`, find the extension, and click the "service worker" link.
    *   **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, find the extension, and click the "Inspect" button.

## Building (Optional)

To create distributable `.zip` packages for each browser:

*   **Build for Chrome (Manifest V3):**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build:chrome
    # or
    npm run build:chrome
    ```
    This command will:
    1.  Clean the previous build output (`dist/` directory).
    2.  Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) for type checking.
    3.  Run `vite build` using `manifest.json`.
    4.  Create a `arena-clipper-chrome.zip` file in the project root containing the built extension.

*   **Build for Firefox (Manifest V2):**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build:firefox
    # or
    npm run build:firefox
    ```
    This command will:
    1.  Clean the previous build output (`dist/` directory).
    2.  Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) for type checking.
    3.  Run `vite build` using `manifest.firefox.json` (via the `BROWSER=firefox` environment variable).
    4.  Create a `arena-clipper-firefox.zip` file in the project root containing the built extension.

These `.zip` files are suitable for uploading to the Chrome Web Store and Mozilla Add-ons (AMO) respectively.
