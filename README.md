# Save to Are.na Browser Extension

A simple browser extension that allows you to quickly save images from any webpage to your Are.na boards.

## Description

This extension adds a small save icon ("‚ßâ") when you hover over images on most websites. Clicking the icon initiates a process to save that image to one of your Are.na boards.

## Features

*   **Hover-to-Save:** An overlay appears on image hover, providing a quick save button.
*   **Are.na Authentication:** Securely connects to your Are.na account using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code flow). You only need to log in once.
*   **Board Selection UI:** After clicking the save button, a UI appears within the overlay allowing you to:
    *   View your 3 most recently updated Are.na boards (fetched initially when the list is empty).
    *   See the list update dynamically as you save items using the extension.
    *   Search for any of your boards by name.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The save button provides visual cues for loading, success (‚úÖ), failure (‚ùå), and authentication required (üîë).

## Installation (Development)

To install this extension locally for development:

**Chrome / Edge (Manifest V3):**

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right).
4.  Click "Load unpacked".
5.  Select the directory containing this `README.md` file (the root project directory).

**Firefox (Manifest V2):**

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.
3.  Click "This Firefox" on the left sidebar.
4.  Click "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5.  Select the `manifest.firefox.json` file from the project directory.

**Note:** For Firefox, the extension will be unloaded when you close the browser unless packaged and installed permanently.

## Configuration

Before the authentication flow can work, you need to replace the placeholder Are.na Client ID:

1.  Register a new application with Are.na developers: [https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications](https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications)
2.  Set the "Redirect URI" for your application during registration. You can find the correct redirect URI for *your specific browser and installation* by:
    *   Loading the extension temporarily (as described above).
    *   Opening the background script console (see Debugging below).
    *   Looking for the log message `Are.na Background Redirect URL: ...` near the top. Copy this value exactly.
3.  Open the file `src/background.ts`.
4.  Find the line `const CLIENT_ID = "ZMhCuoCSLMPEEHAv-ouY1Lk36bTwV-iNbJkL_q7zAjs";` (or similar).
5.  Replace the placeholder string with your actual Client ID obtained from Are.na.
6.  **Important:** Reload the extension in your browser after making this change.

## Development & Project Structure

*   **Manifest Files:**
    *   `manifest.json`: Manifest V3 for Chrome/Edge.
    *   `manifest.firefox.json`: Manifest V2 for Firefox.
*   **Source Directory (`src/`):**
    *   `background.ts`: Handles authentication flow (OAuth) and securely provides the API token to content scripts.
    *   `arena-api.ts`: Module for interacting with the Are.na API (fetching user info, channels, saving blocks) and managing local storage for the API token and the recent boards list (`populateInitialRecentBoards`, `getRecentBoards`, `saveToBoard`, `searchArenaBoards`).
    *   `content/`: Scripts and styles injected into web pages.
        *   `core-overlay.ts`: Responsible for creating and managing the visual overlay (calculating position, creating save button with icon/status elements, handling hover/mouseout logic) and the board selector UI (displaying recent/search results, handling selection/cancel/click-outside).
        *   `arena-handler.ts`: Coordinates the user interaction flow triggered by the save button click. Manages button states (loading, success, error, etc.), orchestrates calls to `arena-api.ts` (ensuring token, populating initial recents, getting recents, saving), and invokes the `showBoardSelector` UI from `core-overlay.ts`.
    *   `style.css`: CSS styles for the injected UI elements (overlay, button, board selector, lists, input).
*   **Assets:** `arena-logo.svg`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`.

### Debugging

*   **Content Scripts:** Open the regular Developer Tools (F12) on any webpage where the extension is active. Logs from `core-overlay.ts` and `arena-handler.ts` will appear in the Console tab.
*   **Background Script:**
    *   **Chrome/Edge:** Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`, find the extension, and click the "service worker" link.
    *   **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, find the extension, and click the "Inspect" button.

## Building (Optional)

You can use tools like `web-ext` to lint, build, and package the extension for distribution:

```bash
# Install web-ext (if you haven't already)
npm install --global web-ext

# Lint the extension (checks manifest files, etc.)
web-ext lint --source-dir ./ --ignore-files node_modules/**

# Build for Firefox (creates a .zip file)
web-ext build --source-dir ./ --filename arena-clipper-firefox.zip --manifest manifest.firefox.json --overwrite-dest --ignore-files node_modules/** *.git*

# Build for Chrome (creates a .zip file - requires adjusting manifest path if needed)
# Note: web-ext primarily targets Firefox manifest, manual checks might be needed for Chrome V3 specifics
web-ext build --source-dir ./ --filename arena-clipper-chrome.zip --manifest manifest.json --overwrite-dest --ignore-files node_modules/** *.git*
```
